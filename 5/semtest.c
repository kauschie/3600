 * Demonstrate using semaphores to protect critical sections of code.
 *
 * USAGE: ./semtest 
 *
 *     CTRL-C     # to stop program
 *
 * Read comments completely before executing the code. This program does not 
 * remove your semaphores. You need to do it manually as shown here.
 *
 *   $ gcc -o semtest semtest.c
 *   $ ./semtest
 *
 *   Hit Ctrl-C to end both
 *   $ ipcs  # list your semaphores when finished
 *   $ ipcrm -s {semaphore id}  # remove your semaphores if necessary
 * 
 * Of the three components in the SysV IPC suite--message queues, shared memory 
 * and semaphores--semaphores are the most difficult to use because they always
 * involve process synchronization. You use semaphores to keep multiple 
 * processes from accessing shared resources at the wrong time.  
 *
 * Synchronization does not need to involve message passing. So why not use 
 * a counter to indicate that a process is using a certain resource? 
 *
 * Assume two processes need to access a some device, but only one of them at
 * a time may use it. Each could agree on a spot to hold a reference counter. 
 * If one process reads the counter and sees 1, it is understood that another 
 * process is using the hardware. If the value of the counter is 0, then the 
 * process is free to use the resource as long as the counter is set to 
 * 1 for the duration of the hardware operation and reset to 0 at the end.
 *
 * There are two problems with this scenario. The first is that setting up the 
 * shared counter and agreeing upon its location can be problematic. Second,  
 * the get and set operations needed to lock the hardware resource are not 
 * atomic, so are not in themselves synchronized; i.e, if one process were to 
 * read the counter as 0 but become preempted by another process before it had 
 * the chance to set the counter to 1, the second process might be able to read 
 * and set the counter. Both processes would think they could use the hardware. 
 * There is no way to know if the other process (or processes) also set the 
 * counter. You have a race condition. Semaphores solve both these problems by 
 * providing a common interface to applications and by implementing an atomic 
 * test or set operation.
 *
 * The SysV implementation of semaphores is more general than the above scenario
 * and also more complicated (POSIX standard is easier but less widely used).
 * First, the value of a semaphore can be not just 0/1, but 0 or any positive 
 * integer:
 *
 * struct sem {
 *    int semval;  # semaphore value - this is any non-negative or zero integer 
 *    int sempid;  # PID for last operation that performed op on this sem
 * };
 *
 * Next, multiple semaphore operations can be performed atomically, much like 
 * the msgrcv type parameter in shared message queues. The operations are sent 
 * as a set of instructions to the kernel. Either all are run or none are run. 
 * The instructions go in a struct called sembuf; see /usr/include/sys/sem.h:
 *
 * struct sembuf {    
 *    unsigned short int sem_num;  # denotes a semaphore in the set: 0,1,2,... 
 *    short int sem_op;    # the semaphore operation 
 *    short int sem_flg;   # the operation flag 
 *  };    
 *
 *  Details:
 *  1. sem_num: denotes which semaphore from the set to perform the ops on 
 *  2. sem_op: A signed int containing the instruction or test to be performed.
 *  3. sem_flg: A combination of the familiar IPC_NOWAIT flag, which indicates 
 *     if the test should return immediately or block until it passes, and 
 *     SEM_UNDO, which causes the semaphore operations to be undone if the 
 *     process should exit prematurely.
 *
 * Values for sem_op:
 *
 * + If sem_op is 0, sem_num is tested to see if its value is 0; if so, the 
 *   next test runs. If sem_num is not 0, either the operation blocks until the 
 *   semaphore becomes 0 if IPC_NOWAIT is not set, or the rest of the tests are 
 *   skipped if IPC_NOWAIT is set.
 *
 * + If sem_op is a positive integer, the value of sem_op is added to the value 
 *   of the semaphore.
 *
 * + If sem_op is a negative integer and the value of the semaphore is greater 
 *   than or equal to the absolute value of sem_op, then the absolute value is 
 *   subtracted from the value of the semaphore.
 *
 * + If sem_op is a negative int and the value of the semaphore is less than 
 *   the absolute value of sem_op, then the execution of test immediately stops 
 *   if IPC_NOWAIT is true, or blocks until the semaphore's value becomes
 *   greater than the absolute value of sem_op if false.
 *
 * The code below demonstrates the use of semaphores. The program can be run 
 * several times simultaneously, but it ensures that only one process is in the 
 * critical section at a time. The simplest case of semaphores is used: the 
 * resource is free if the value of the semaphore is 0.
 *
 * The program starts off by creating a new semaphore set from the kernel with
 * semset. A semaphore set is a group of semaphores sharing a common IPC 
 * instance. The number of semaphores in the set cannot be changed. If the 
 * semaphore set has been created, the 2nd parameter to semget is effectively 
 * ignored. If semget returns a negative integer indicating failure, the reason 
 * is printed, and the program exits.
 *
 * Just before the main while loop, sem_num and sem_flg are initialized because 
 * they stay consistent throughout this. SEM_UNDO is specified so that if the 
 * holder of the semaphore exits before the semaphore can be released, all the 
 * other applications are not locked out.
 *
 * Within the loop, the status of each sem op is displayed, prefaced by process 
 * name. Before entering the critical section, the process locks the semaphore. 
 * Two semaphore instructions are specified. The first is 0, which means the
 * process waits until the semaphore value returns to 0. The second is 1, which 
 * means that after the semaphore returns to 0, 1 is added to the semaphore. 
 * The process calls semop to run the instructions, passing semaphore ID, the 
 * address of the data structure, and the number of sembuf instructions to use.
 * 
 * After semop returns the process knows it has locked the semaphore and prints 
 * a message to indicate this. The critical section then runs, which in this 
 * case is a pause for a random number of seconds. Finally, the semaphore is 
 * released by running a single sembuf command with a semop value of -1, 
 * which has the effect of subtracting 1 from the semaphore and returning its 
 * value to 0. More debugging output is printed, the process pauses randomly,
 * and execution continues. Sample output of two instances of this application:
 *
 *   [a] Waiting for the semaphore to be released
 *   [a] I have the semaphore
 *   [b] Waiting for the semaphore to be released
 *   [a] Released semaphore
 *   [b] I have the semaphore
 *   [a] Waiting for the semaphore to be released
 *   [b] Released semaphore
 *   [a] I have the semaphore
 *   [a] Released semaphore
 *   [a] Waiting for the semaphore to be released
 *   [a] I have the semaphore
 * 
 * Two instances of the program are executed, with their respective pids 'a' 
 * and 'b' displayed. First, 'a' obtains the semaphore, and while holding it, 
 * 'b' tries to obtain a lock. As soon as 'a' releases the semaphore, 'b' is 
 * given the lock. The situation reverses itself with 'a' waiting for 'b' to 
 * finish. Finally, 'a' gets the semaphore again after releasing it, because 
 * 'b' was not waiting.
 *
 * The last item to note about semaphores is that they are really just advisory 
 * locks, meaning  that the semaphores themselves do not prevent two processes 
 * from using the same resource simultaneously; rather, they are just to advise 
 * anyone willing to ask if the resource is already in use.
