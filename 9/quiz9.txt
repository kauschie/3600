1. Semaphores always protect a shared resource and in this case semaphore x's 
    critical section involves the readcount variable and ensures that it is
        updated properly.

2. wsem is protecting the shared buffer involved in the read and write operations 
    READUNIT() and WRITEUNIT()

3. The first reader waits for wsem "if (readcount == 1)"

4. The last one

5. one

6. all of them

7. That the first reader will be allowed in immediately to begin waiting for the
    wsem semaphore. Once he's able to grab it he lets the rest of the readers in.

8. Writers are subject to starvation because once one reader begins reading the
    readers can retrain control of the data as long is one reader is still reading
