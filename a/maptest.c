 * Program description...
 * Prints part of the file specified in its first command-line argument to 
 * standard output. The range of bytes to be printed is specified via offset 
 * and length values in the second and third command-line arguments. The 
 * program creates a memory mapping of the required pages of the file and then 
 * uses write(2) to output the desired bytes.
 *
 * Notes: mmap allows multiple processes to share virtual memory; unlike SysV 
 * IPC, mmap structures are not persistent; when attached to a file there is 
 * no inherent synchronization so processes will not always see the same data;
 * the segment is copied into RAM and periodically flushed to disk; 
 * synchronization can be forced with the msync system call.
 * 
 * A file is mapped in multiples of the page size so the offset into the file
 * must be page aligned.

	/* From mmap manpage:
	 *
	 *   void *mmap(void *addr, size_t length, int prot, int flags, 
	 *           int fd, off_t offset);
	 *
	 * mmap() creates a new mapping in the virtual address space of the calling
	 * process. The starting address for the new mapping is specified
	 * in addr. The length argument specifies the length of the mapping.
	 *
	 * If addr is NULL, the kernel chooses the address to create the mapping
	 * otherwise addr is a *recommendation*; the address of new mapping is
	 * returned.
	 *
	 * The contents of a file mapping are initialized using length bytes
	 * starting at offset offset in the file referred to by the file descriptor
	 * fd. Offset must be a multiple of the page size as returned by
	 * sysconf(_SC_PAGE_SIZE).
	 *
	 * The prot arg defines the memory protection of the mapping:
	 *       PROT_EXEC  Pages may be executed.
	 *       PROT_READ  Pages may be read.
	 *       PROT_WRITE Pages may be written.
	 *       PROT_NONE  Pages may not be accessed.
	 *
	 * The flags argument determines whether updates to the mapping are visible
	 * to other processes mapping the same region, and whether updates are
	 * carried through to the underlying file.This behavior is determined by
	 * including exactly one of the following values in flags:
	 *
	 * MAP_SHARED Share this mapping. Updates to the mapping are visible to
	 * other processes that map this file and are carried through to the
	 * underlying file. The file may not actually be updated until msync(2) or
	 * munmap() is called.
	 *
	 * MAP_PRIVATE
	 * Create a private copy-on-write mapping. Updates to the mapping are not 
	 * visible to other processes mapping the same file, and are not carried 
	 * through to the underlying file.
	 *
	 * Memory mapped by mmap() is preserved across fork(2) with the same
	 * attributes.
	 *
	 * A file is mapped in multiples of the page size. For a file that is not
	 * a multiple of the page size, the remaining memory is zeroed when mapped,
	 * and writes to that region are not written out to the file.  
	 *
	 * MAP_ANONYMOUS
	 * The mapping is not backed by any file; its contents are initialized to
	 * zero. The fd and offset arguments are ignored; however, some
	 * implementations require fd to be -1 for MAP_ANONYMOUS and portable
	 * applications should do this. The use of MAP_ANONYMOUS with MAP_SHARED
	 * is supported since kernel 2.4.
	 *
	 * RETURN VALUE 
	 * On success, mmap() returns a pointer to the mapped area.  
	 *
	 * Use of a mapped region can result in these signals:
	 *
	 * SIGSEGV 
	 * Attempted write into a region mapped as read-only.
	 *
	 * SIGBUS 
	 * Attempted access to a portion of the buffer that does not correspond to
	 * the file (for example, beyond end of the file.)
