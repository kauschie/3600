 * filename: shared_mem.c
 *
 * Demonstate the use of SysV IPC shared memory mechanism by a parent and 
 * child read and write to a shared memory segment.
 *
 * Shared memory is a powerful and yet easy to implement component of the SysV 
 * IPC suite. As the name implies a block of memory is shared between processes.
 * The program below calls fork(2) to split itself into a parent process and a 
 * child process, communicating between the two using a shared memory segment.
 *
 *  $ gcc shared_mem.c -o shared_mem
 *
 *  $./shared_mem
 *  child  set 1, reads: 1
 *  parent set 2, reads: 2
 *  parent set 4, reads: 4
 *  child  set 3, reads: 4
 *
 *  $./shared_mem
 *  parent set 2, reads: 2
 *  child  set 1, reads: 1
 *  parent set 4, reads: 4
 *  child  set 3, reads: 4
 *
 * The output will vary. It is a race condition as to whether instructions 
 * in the parent or instructions in the child process will be scheduled by the 
 * OS first. This code uses sleep in both the parent and the child to simulate
 * some producer/consumer activity. This is simply to demonstrate how shared
 * memory works. NEVER use sleep to synchronize processes. Lab04 will introduce
 * semaphores, which is what you will eventually use to synchronize.
 *
 * Under some flavors of Unix the parent and the child may have a different
 * pointer address to the shared memory segment. It is a logical 'shared memory 
 * segment' and the IPC interface takes care of sharing the areas. This would
 * cause a problem with linked lists; for linked lists you would need to use
 * relative addressing. The address in Linux is the same, so not a problem.
 *
 * The parameters to shmget are key, size, and flags. The size of the shared 
 * memory area in this example is a single integer. The use of IPC_PRIVATE for 
 * the IPC key means a unique IPC ID is guaranteed to be created. The process
 * is thus responsible to distribute the ID. In the example, shmid is known by 
 * both the parent and child because they are 'cloned' copies of each other. 
 *
 * NOTE AGAIN: 
 * In this simple example, one process pauses while the other is writing to the 
 * shared memory segment. In coming labs you will use semaphores (the third 
 * component of the SysV IPC suite) to enforce mutual exclusion (locking one 
 * process out while another process has access to the resource) and 
 * synchronization (enforcing the order of access).
 *
 * Using sleep to control the order in which the parent and the child access
 * shared memory is never a good idea, but for now it will have to do.
