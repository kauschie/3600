/*
 *  echo.c
 *
 *  Demonstrate classic producer/consumer problem; the parent thread (the 
 *  producer) writes one character at a time from a file into a shared buffer
 *
 *  The buffer is shared because it is defined globally.
 *
 *  The consumer reads from buffer and writes it to a log file. With no 
 *  synchronization, the consumer will read the same character multiple times
 *  because the producer is slower than the consumer.
 *  Output is not deterministic - it varies across executions. 
 *
 *  This is a problem of concurrency. When two threads access shared resources 
 *  without synchronization it is a race condition as to which thread gets 
 *  there first or next. Without synchronization, the consumer may read a value
 *  multiple times (empty buffer) or the producer overwrite a value before the 
 *  consumer had a chance to read it. 
 *
 *    $ gcc -o echo echo.c -lpthread   # link in POSIX pthread library  
 *    $ ./echo
